Munar Analytics & Reporting - Implementation Plan (Draft)

Goal
- Build a full analytics experience for the Event Creator plan that matches existing design patterns, uses mock-first services, and is backend-ready.

Scope
- Event Dashboard Analytics module with multiple sub-sections/tabs.
- KPI overview and deep-dive analytics sections.
- Export/reporting UI and scheduled reports placeholders.
- Event-scoped comparison (no global all-events view).
- Alerts/notifications surfaces (in-app + email settings).
- Data privacy/consent controls (UI & configuration).

Architecture Alignment
- Pages live in src/pages and receive onNavigate.
- Feature components in src/components/event-dashboard/analytics/.
- Data access via src/services/analytics.service.ts with mock/real toggle.
- Hooks in src/hooks/useAnalytics.ts and related sub-hooks.
- Types in src/types/analytics.ts.
- Mock data in src/services/mock/data.ts.

Navigation + Entry Points
- Event Dashboard -> Analytics tab/page.
- Integrate with ModulesHub if required.

Core Sections (Tabs)
1) Overview
2) Ticket Sales
3) Attendance & Check-Ins
4) Engagement & Interaction
5) Financial Performance
6) Campaign Attribution
7) Content & Session Metrics
8) Leads & Networking
9) Export & Custom Reports
10) Multi-Event Comparison (global)

Data Model (Draft)
- KPI aggregates (tickets sold, revenue, check-ins, NPS, engagement score, revenue/attendee)
- Time series (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Breakdowns (by ticket type, channel, session, campaign)
- Funnel metrics (visitors -> checkout -> purchase)
- Attendance metrics (per session, per tier)
- Engagement metrics (polls, chat, Q&A, bookmarks)
- Financial metrics (revenue streams, costs, ROI)
- Campaign attribution (UTM, source, conversion, revenue)
- Content metrics (views, watch time, downloads)
- Networking metrics (leads, meetings, messages)
- Export/report config (format, schedule, recipients, filters)

UI/UX Patterns
- KPI cards with optional sparklines.
- Charts: line, bar, funnel, heatmap.
- Interactive filters: date range (default 7 days), ticket type, location, channel.
- Drill-down links from summary to detail sections.
- Alerts panel for low stock, sellout spikes, engagement dips.

Phases
Phase 1: Foundations
- Types, services, mock data, hooks.
- Analytics shell page and tab routing.
- Filters bar (date range + multi-select).

Phase 2: Overview + Ticket Sales

Phase 3: Attendance + Engagement
